WHAT IS THE DATASET ABOUT?
 The dataset I’ve choose to work on is “AIR POLLUTION IN 2019”. It 
contains the data of pollution present in various states in the countries in india 
.In this data it has 1048556 rows and 15 columns in which it contain various 
attributes such as –
o Datetime
o Id
o Name
o Longitude
o Latitude
o Live
o City id
o State id
o PM2.5
o PM10
o NO2
o NH3
o SO2
o CO
o OZONE
WHY DID I CHOOSE THIS DATA SET ?
Air Pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances 
in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living 
beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. Since air quality 
can have such a big impact. So,i decided to choose the air pollution 
dataset because this analysis helps me to study the environment. The 
purpose of this is commonly to monitor and study levels of pollutants in 
the atmosphere in different places. 
DOMAIN
Air pollution comes under the domain of “Pollution”. pollution is the 
introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause 
adverse change. Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, 
liquid, or gas) or energy. There are several types of pollution in this air 
pollution is one of those. Air Pollution: the release of chemicals 
and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants 
include Carbon monoxide, Sulphur dioxide, Chlorofluorocarbons(CFCS) 
and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Due to 
these Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides 
and hydrocarbons react to sunlight.
INFO
The Air Pollution dataset contains different type pollutants some of 
which are as follows :
Pollutant Types:-
PM2.5 and PM10
PM2.5 refers to the atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter of 
less than 2.5 micrometres, which is about 3% of the diameter of human 
hair.
The particles in PM2.5 category are so small that they can only be 
detected with the help of the electron microscope. These are smaller than 
PM10 particles. PM10 are the particles with a diameter of 10 micrometres
and they are also called fine particles. An environmental expert says that 
PM10 is also known as respirable particulate matter.
SO2 and NO2 pollutants
The most important sources of SO2 are fossil fuel combustion, smelting, 
manufacture of sulphuric acid, conversion of wood pulp to paper, 
incineration of refuse and production of elemental sulphur. Coal burning 
is the single largest man-made source of SO2 accounting for about 50% 
of annual global emissions, with oil burning accounting for a further 25-
30%.
Globally, quantities of nitrogen oxides produced naturally (by bacterial and 
volcanic action and lightning) far outweigh anthropogenic (man-made) 
emissions. Anthropogenic emissions are mainly due to fossil fuel 
combustion from both stationary sources, i.e. power generation (21%), 
and mobile sources, i.e. transport (44%). Other atmospheric contributions 
come from non-combustion processes, for example nitric acid 
manufacture, welding processes and the use of explosives.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide are 
important ambient air pollutants. High-intensity, confined space exposure 
to NO2 has caused catastrophic injury to humans, including death. 
Ambient NO2 exposure may increase the risk of respiratory tract 
infections through the pollutant's interaction with the immune system. 
Sulphur dioxide (SO2) contributes to respiratory symptoms in both healthy 
patients and those with underlying pulmonary disease.
CO
The major source of atmospheric CO is the spark ignition combustion 
engine. Smaller contributions come from processes involving the 
combustion of organic matter, for example in power stations and waste 
incineration.
OZONE
Most O3 in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) is formed indirectly by the 
action of sunlight on nitrogen dioxide - there are no direct emissions of O3 
to the atmosphere. About 10 - 15% of tropospheric O3 is transported from 
the stratosphere where it is formed by the action of ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation on O2.
 GOALS/PLANS
o States with high pollution
o Analysing the pollutants with respects to the states
o Analysing the pollutant value in each state 
o Sorting the list of states with the pollutants present 
o Number of pollutants measuring stations per state
o Checking whether the pollution depends on season 
o Checking the monthly average of the pollution
o What time of the day has more pollution 
o Pollution on weekends vs weekdays
o Pollution during festival seasons
